What's going on here?
=====================

A dotjs script to play your sweepstakes games at [SurveyMonkey
Contribute](https://contribute.surveymonkey.com/home).

Turns out you can accumulate a lot of games, and playing them
takes a while. This cycles through them all until they are
exhausted or you hit a win. Should stop on the win page, altho'
I've never seen it :)

Setup
-----

 - Drop the js file into your ```~/.js/``` directory
 - Setup this [https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs)
 - Visit here to start [SurveyMonkey
Contribute](https://contribute.surveymonkey.com/home)

This is essentially scraping, so it's gonna break.
