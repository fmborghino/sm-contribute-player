What's going on here?
=====================

A js script to play your sweepstakes games at [SurveyMonkey
Contribute](https://contribute.surveymonkey.com/home).

Turns out you can accumulate a lot of games, and playing them
takes a while. This cycles through them all until they are
exhausted or you hit a win. Should stop on the win page, altho'
I've never seen it :)

Setup
-----

The runs in the context of a script injector on your browser.

A good one currently for Chrome is
[CJS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija).

An alternative (no longer maintained) is
[dotjs](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs). This requires more setup than
CJS.

Once your injector is setup, visit here to start [SurveyMonkey
Contribute](https://contribute.surveymonkey.com/home)

Note this is essentially scraping, so it's gonna break.
